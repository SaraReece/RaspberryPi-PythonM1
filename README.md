# Overview

This repository is tracking my progress through the [RaspberryPi intro to Python Pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-intro)

I worked through their projects and created an archery game and rocket launch game. I created a project that autogenerates patterns as well as a basic face drawing program and a hello world intro project. 

My goal in writting this software was to learn the syntax of the Python programming language.

# Development Environment

I used the code editor trinket.io that is recommended by Raspberry Pi to compelte these projects

I did this with Python utilizing the p5, randint, math, datetime, and emoji libraries. 
# Useful Websites


* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)


# Future Work
* Flesh out the face project more
* Complete the fifth project
* Play a little more with the random pattern project
